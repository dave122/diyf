ABOUT DIYF
==========
DIYF is a tool that allows anyone to edit the copy of a website themselves. This helps
- reduce the cycle time / overhead needed to make copy changes to the website
- allow those who do not have commit access to the code (or non-technical team members) to make website copy changes directly though the website.
